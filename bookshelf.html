    <h2>Resurrection</h2>
    <div class="author">Leo Tolstoy</div>
    <p>
      Serving on a jury at the trial of a prostitute arrested for
      murder, Prince Nekhlyudov is horrified to discover that the
      accused is a woman he had once loved, seduced and then abandoned
      when she was a young servant girl. Racked with guilt at
      realizing he was the cause of her ruin, he determines to appeal
      for her release or give up his own way of life and follow
      her. Conceived on an epic scale, "Resurrection" portrays a vast
      panorama of Russian life, taking us from the underworld of
      prison cells and warders to the palaces of countesses. It is
      also an angry denunciation of government, the upper classes, the
      judicial system and the Church, and a highly personal statement
      of Tolstoy's belief in human redemption.
