Ford is know for having paid his workers $5 a day. Today we hear this and
remember what a great man Ford was. At the time this is what the *Wall Street
Journal* had to say:

<blockquote>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> accused Henry Ford of &#8220;economic blunders if not
crimes&#8221; which would soon &#8220;return to plague him and the industry he
represents as well as organized society.&#8221; In a naive wish for social
improvement, declared the newspaper, Ford had injected &#8220;spiritual principles
into a field where they do not belong&#8221;--a heinous crime--and captains of
industry lined up to condemn &#8220;the most foolish thing ever attempted in the
industrial world.&#8221;<br /><br /><cite>- Robert Lacey</cite></blockquote>
