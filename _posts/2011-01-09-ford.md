Ford is know for having paid his workers $5 a day. Today we hear this and
remember what a great man Ford was. At the time this is what the *Wall Street
Journal* had to say:

<blockquote>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> accused Henry Ford of "economic blunders if not
crimes" which would soon "return to plague him and the industry he
represents as well as organized society." In a naive wish for social
improvement, declared the newspaper, Ford had injected "spiritual principles
into a field where they do not belong"--a heinous crime--and captains of
industry lined up to condemn "the most foolish thing ever attempted in the
industrial world."<br /><br /><cite>- Robert Lacey</cite></blockquote>
