Throughout my years in high school and college I was unaware of the value held
in many literary pieces. At the time these masterful pieces, such as
*Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville and *The Old Man and the Sea* by Ernest Hemingway,
carried little significance. Even the most recent books like *The Shadow of the Wind*
by Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n did not capture my attention. Only recently have I come
to discover the great world of literature. In high school and college, I would
not be caught dead reading Robert Frost, now I can say what great works he has
written!

A change in attitude has occurred. No longer was I confined by need to read for
a grade. The first few months after my formal education I was 
rejoicing in the fact that I was not obligated to read. Gradually
overtime my interest grew. How could such a large industry exists? Why do
people seek recognition as a famous writer when the world already has
so many of them? The only answer that I can conclude is that literature has lit a 
fire deep inside the soul. But I hated reading and anything to do with it in
school! How someone could even
major in the subject was beyond me. So I bought a book, *The Shadow of the
Wind*.

From the first page my mind went to a world that was a part of someone
else's imagination! This was not something that I had experienced in school. In
school I read to answer questions for a quiz. But this, this was a pleasure to
read! The school was not forcing curiosity upon me, I was being curious out of
my accord.

Over time my collection of books grew. In the past year alone I have read more
books than while in school and with greater interest than ever before. My
curiosity has grown from just one book into a daily activity.

This growth did not occur due to a program. When in school the goal of
reading was to pass the class! Who cares if you actually read, just pass the
class. Pizza Hut used to have a reading program (and still might). What
did I want from that program, pizza! What did I want when I picked up *The
Shadow of the Wind*? To understand the book itself, to see why books captivated
people.

So many areas exists that have captivate other people but I have left untouched. Recently I have taken
dance lessons. Again this is something I would have never done before. The key,
I have found is to develop a natural curiosity, similar to that of a kids. A
kid does not care about the dangers of an adventure, he goes forth and conquers!
Sometimes he looks like a fool, but that doesn't stop him from going on other
adventures. Satisfy the natural curiosity by exploring. In my case I recently
discovered reading. The adventures don't end there though...
