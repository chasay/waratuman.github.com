extract: "<p>\"It's not how you start, it's how you finish.\" These words come from
the song *Ali in the Jungle* by The Hours. The finish differentiates those
who have overcome the obstacles from those who have not overcome
obstacles. The finish sums up the greatest moments of the
race. Between the start and the end is where misfortune befalls the
brave souls who are actually in the race. What happens when those in
the race run out of breath, cramp up, or worse yet fall and injure
themselves? That is up to the person. The person who falls can either
let the situation control him or step up and overcome the
situation. The great people in this world don't become limp and let
the situation bring defeat. No! They stand and accept no excuse, but
finish the race.</p>"

"It's not how you start, it's how you finish." These words come from
the song *Ali in the Jungle* by The Hours. The finish differentiates those
who have overcome the obstacles from those who have not overcome
obstacles. The finish sums up the greatest moments of the
race. Between the start and the end is where misfortune befalls the
brave souls who are actually in the race. What happens when those in
the race run out of breath, cramp up, or worse yet fall and injure
themselves? That is up to the person. The person who falls can either
let the situation control him or step up and overcome the
situation. The great people in this world don't become limp and let

finish the race. 

Ludwig van Beethoven could have stopped performing after he lost his
hearing with completely understanding by those around him. But no, he
did not stop. Pure ability isn't what carried him through or developed
his ability as a musician. He took it upon himself to overcome
challenges. Beethoven did not let his health bring him down or control
him; it was not his condition that dictated what he could or could not
do, it was Beethoven who decided what he could and could not
do. Beethoven controlled his own destiny in spite of any obstacles. 

The song *Ali in the Jungle* also names Simpson who overcame
huge obstacles that would have brought weaker men to their
death. Simpson was a mountaineer who was left for dead after having
broken his leg and fallen into a crevasse, yet he fought hypothermia
and dehydration while crawling back to camp for 3 1/2 days. Simpson,
abandoned, alone, and in poor condition did not let his
situation stop him, instead he overcame deathly challenges.

Men like this aren't found. They can't be found. These men make
themselves into what they want. These men can
come back from any situation because they refuse to surrender
control. They don't lay back and relax, surrendering to temporary
pleasures, they don't stop because of a broken leg, surrendering control
to outside influences. They make their own path in life. Every man
stumbles. The difference between a regular man and a great man is that
a great man knows how to come back from a stumble. A great man
finishes the race no matter what obstacles present themselves.
