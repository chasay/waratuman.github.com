Running a start up is difficult, business men make it more
difficult. The goal of a business man is to grow a company or manage a
company. This is what the MBA is all about. A huge company that needs
management needs these people. A small company does not need these
people. The focus of the small startup needs to be on the user of the
products and the products themselves. This is not the focus of the
business man.

The two reasons that the focus of the business man is not on the
product is that he sees himself in more of an administrative
roll and he does not have the slightest understanding of the
intricacies of the product. 

These business men think of their job as managing the people and to
get the *employees* to perform. This is what the business man thinks a good
company is made of, well performing *employees*. It is true that a good company is made of people
who perform and execute well, but those people don't perform or execute well
because of a manager. The people who perform and execute do so because they have
found a drive inside themselves. External motivation from a person who
does not understand what you are doing is useless. In fact this kind
of motivation gives birth to lazy people because the goal of the
*employee* is to appease the boss, not make a better product or invest
in the company.
  
This is also why business men get all the resentment
they deserve, they manipulate to get you to perform and hold you to a
different standard then they hold themselves. If you are performing
well, the manager is performing well. So they think they can reward
themselves with higher salaries and always having those weekends off
in the mountains. But when you don't perform well they demand more
hours and threaten you while they take the higher salary and the
weekend get-aways. The manager takes out the rage of poor performance
on the employee when it was the manager who had caused this. The focus
here is not on the product, it is on the employee and getting him to
perform well, and no one wants to work at a job with a manager
breathing down your neck.

The other reason why business men are typically not worth having in a
start up is that they only point out problems in the technology. They
are powerless to fix the issues. The problems that they point out they
want fixed right away. Business men can not recognize the
difference between a problem which is only skin deep and a problem
that cause the heart to stop. They will suggest solutions that fix
only the symptom rather than the problem, and they are happy with this
because they are oblivious to the real problem. So the product can
become covered in bandages when what was need was a heart
transplant. A doctor spends years studying before he is considered
qualified to diagnose or treat a health issue. Having a business man
review your product is like having a 2 year old diagnose a rare
disease.

Now, this may be a little harsh. The business people can do the job
when it comes to the taxes or raising money or making a showing at a
party. Ultimately the business man needs to take a hold of the product
and try and understand the technology behind it and stop managing the
people who don't want or need to be managed. When starting a company,
the business man is perhaps the most useless because he has no direct
ability to improve the product and the skills he posses can easily be
learned by someone else or found in another hire. When you are in a small
company no one needs a middle man, and that is what business man is.
