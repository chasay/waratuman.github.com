It is common to hear of the *emotional roller coaster* in the start-up
world. One day everything is going great while the next the world is
collapsing in on itself. In a startup some of these nerve-wracking
events are foreseen others are not.

Raising cash and launching products are planned events. These
events are very difficult and are hard to get through, although
knowing of these events before they happen brings at least of sense of
control. Be ready for these events and you will keep your cool.

The worst part of the roller coaster is what is hiding around the
bend. It is unseen and unknown and can not be prepared for. This is
where everything that you risked is on the line. Nothing is safe, not
your personal life, not your social life, not your friendships, not
your family. Everything that can go wrong will go wrong. The world
will come within an inch of destruction. This is when it is
impossible to keep your head.

This previous weekend the biggest drop on the *emotional roller
coaster* was waiting, hiding behind a bend. On Saturday life was
amazing and one could not ask for anything more. Come Saturday
night, life was in decay. I was dealing with some personal issues, my
brother and co-founder had a possibly had a server injury to one of
his knees, some members of our company were having some serious issues
communication, and I was having an awkward time with some friends of
mine. Four huge issues, of which any one could have been detrimental
to either myself, my friends, or the company. This is what I was never
be prepared for and have no way of being prepared for.

Each of these problems only magnified the others. Taken one at a time,
these are not as taxing and are very survivable. Taken all at once,
well that is a challenge.

So how did I survive such a crazy day? I escaped for a time. I went
where no one else was. Just me and a book. The time away allowed me to
recollect myself and be away from the difficulties. Coming back I was
better able to deal with the situations.

Come Monday, the problems started to melt away. My personal issues
were dealt with, my brother's knee was only sprained, my co-workers
were working towards a solution, and I found that I was only being a
fool when it came to the interactions with my friends.

This whole weekend was an unseen emotional ride that was far worse
than any other I have taken. Thankfully it only lasted for 2 days. It
was a long 2 days though. Raising money and launching a product are
still big challenges, but after this I will not look at them the same way.
