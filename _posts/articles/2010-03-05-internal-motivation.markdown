California recently cut educational funding. Students rose up
protesting higher student fees and smaller class offerings. Every one
of those students is likely driven by external motivation rather than
internal motivation.

The externally motivated student’s dreams fade when events like a
raise in tuition or competition for entry to a class
raises. Statements such as “They’re cutting the future,”

come from these students. When a challenge arises externally motivated
people cower in fear. Dreams die because the primary force behind the
dream was not the person who had the dream.

Internally motivated people take responsibility for the dream. A
challenge only causes the internally motivated to work harder to
achieve the dream. The dream does not disappear because the holder of
the dream is the person and not an outside force.

The internally motivated step up their game when a challenge comes;
the externally motivated give up their game when a challenge comes.

The internally motivated student will fork over the funds or look for
alternate ways to fund his or her education. The extremely motivated
will try to either deny what has happened and simply hope for the
best. Notice which student will act.
