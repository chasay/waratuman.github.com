The following instructions are for installing and programming `Ada` on Arch Linux.

## Prerequisites

Install the `Ada` compiler `GNAT` with the following command:

    $ pacman -S gcc-ada

After `pacman` has finished the install the `gnat` command will be available to compile `Ada` programs.

## Hello, World!

The first thing to do in any new language is the classic "Hello, World!" program. This will introduce us to the feel of `Ada` and give us an idea of what we can expect.

Lets get started. First we will create a new directory for this program.

    $ mkdir ~/src/hello_world
    $ cd ~/src/hello_world

Now get started writing the program in a new file called `hello_world.adb`.

    with Ada.Text_IO;
    
    procedure Hello_World is
    begin
       Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!");
    end Hello_World;

Compile and run:

    $ gnat make hello_world.adb
    $ ./hello_world
    Hello, World!

Great, we finsihed our first Ada program! Next up is the first problem from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

<blockquote><p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p></blockquote>


Open a new file called `euler1.adb` and type the following text inside:

    with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
    
    procedure Euler1 is
        package IO renames Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
        Sum : Integer;
    begin

	Sum := 0;
	
	for I in Integer range 1..999 loop
	    if I mod 3 = 0 then
	       Sum := Sum + I;
	    elsif I mod 5 = 0 then
	       Sum := Sum + I;
	    end if;
	end loop;
	
	IO.Put(Sum); 
    end Euler1;

Again, compile and run:

    $ gnat make euler1.adb
    $ ./euler1
         233168

Great! 233168 is the correct answer. Now on to problem number 2! This problem is a little harder, but it is still just counting numbers.

<blockquote><p>Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed four million.</p></blockquote>

Start another file titled `euler2.adb` and type the following text:

    with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
    use Ada;
    
    procedure Euler2 is
    
        Fib1 : Natural;
        Fib2 : Natural;
        Sum : Natural;
   
    begin
        Sum := 0;
        Fib1 := 1;
        Fib2 := 2;
   
        while Fib1 < 4_000_000 and Fib2 < 4_000_000 loop
      	
            if Fib1 > Fib2 then
                if Fib1 mod 2 = 0 then
                    Sum := Sum + Fib1;
                end if;
                Fib2 := Fib1 + Fib2;
            else
                if Fib2 mod 2 = 0 then
                    Sum := Sum + Fib2;
                end if;
                Fib1 := Fib1 + Fib2;
            end if;
        end loop;
	
        Integer_Text_IO.Put(Sum);
   
    end Euler2;

Compile and run to get the result:

    $ gnat make euler2.adb
    $ ./euler2
        4613732

And this concludes the short tangent into `Ada`. The compile is up and running and we are solving some problems. Go ahead and do a few more at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).
