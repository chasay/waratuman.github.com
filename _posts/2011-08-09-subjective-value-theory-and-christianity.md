How do we bring together the subjective value theory and Christianity? From
the outset is seems as though the scientific approach of praxeology leads us
to the result that there is no ultimate judge or yardstick that can ever be
applied to mankind and that in the end all that maters is that man has
attempted to achieve what he has valued. Yet science itself does not care to
make the judgement about what does matter and what does not matter. Instead the
source of this judgement must come from outside science and even man himself.
Man is unable to analyze any action outside the reference of his own value
system. In Christianity the doctrine free will, which has been given to every
man, gives man the ability to make his own value judgements. He is free to set
his heart on whatever he pleases, wether that be &#8220;an idol in the form of anything
in heaven or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8221; <sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> or God himself. Man
is free to give his life in service to anything he pleases. Praxeology is only
a science and does not concern itself moral or ethical questions, it only
seeks to establish laws of human action that come from observation and
experimentation. Religion on the other hand does concern itself with the moral
and ethical questions of mankind. But just because the subjective value theory
implies that no man can judge another person's decision does not mean that
there is not an ultimate judge or yardstick that man may one day be measured
against. The fields of science can not even reason with an all knowing, all
powerful judge in the same way that man himself will never understand God.

All that is required for man to act is that he believe that a certain ends
will satisfy him and that he have the power to affect his current state of
being. It matters not if the ends will actually satisfy him or if the way he
goes about achieving the ends is flawed. For praxeology this is enough, but
for the man looking for the ultimate state of satisfaction it is not. Many
value money, fame, power, relationships and sex. Yet as humans we will never
find satisfaction in any earthly or material thing. Can science prove that man
will ever be satisfied? Man must continually work for what he values. Every
time he comes back to his idol again, more is necessary in order to be
satisfied. Man must fight the law of diminishing marginal utility. What human
could even claim to be fully satisfied unless he had complete knowledge of the
world and had infinite power to attain any ends that he wanted? No such man
exists. If such man did exists he would instead be a god. Man continually
works for nourishment, if he could be in the state of ultimate satisfaction,
he would not be looking to feed himself.

Science will never tell us if a man will be satisfied by a certain ends. That
knowledge is only given to the man who has achieved his end. Instead we must
seek a different source of knowledge to understand human nature and how man
can even hope to achieve satisfaction. This is the realm of religion. What of
the judge who handed down his commandments to Moses atop Mount Sinai?

Following the economic crisis of 2008 I was surprised to find that the CFO of
Freddie Mac hung himself in his basement and that several other executives of
real estate companies, investment firms, and bankers had committed suicide. It
is not just those who value money and wealth who find themselves depressed to
the point of suicide. How many people struggle with the need to be in a
relationship and often find themselves struggling when they are in one? This
applies to any idol in the world. &#8220;The incomplete joys of this world will
never satisfy [the human] heart&#8221; noted [Alexis de Tocqueville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville).

It is hard for human nature to recognize its own idols. Idols blind. Idols
are the what we value the most. As humans we each have decided what the idol
we value the most, and we can not look away because we are under the illusion
that the idol can bring us to a state of satisfaction. It is valued so much
that it can causes to cross moral and ethical bounds we would not normally
cross. The satisfaction that is brings is only temporary. It is likely that
we will return once again to our idols seeking more and more. It can be more
money, more power, or more affection.

If there is nothing in the world that can satisfy us what is left? The one
thing the Lord commanded was that he be first in life. &#8220;I am the Lord your
Godâ€¦ you shall have no other gods before me.&#8221; <sup><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> All the other worldly focuses
like fame, security, and prosperity can serve as an idol and a temporary
source of happiness that in the end will fail. None of these things are bad,
but when they replace God himself man will never find peace. It is great to
be famous, it is great to be safe, it is great rich, but it is only satisfying
when God is first.

God allowed every person to value what he wants. It is your life to live, free
to make your own decisions. Bug God has warned us that the idols of the world
will not satisfy in the long run. Put your heart where you will, but it will
only be satisfied in Christ.
