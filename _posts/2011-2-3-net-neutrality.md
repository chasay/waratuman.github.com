[Network neutrality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality) has
become a hotly debated topic these past few years. Should [ISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider)s
be allowed to restrict data on their networks? Net neutrality advocates that
ISP should not restrict data of any kind, weather it is website, services, or
protocols.

If the ISP are privately held companies, then I see no reason as to why the
government or any other body should enforce regulation upon the company to
offer its services to its customers. The contract between the ISPs and their
customers is of mutual consent, otherwise such a contract would not exists.
Generally there are also multiple ISP from which a customer may choose to
do business with. If one ISP decides to block www.google.com, then customers
who find Google valuable would either seek to change the contract with their
current ISP or move to another. It is possible that there may only be one
source of internet for a customer. The customer can demand that the ISP
provide unrestricted access to the network, but the company is under no
obligation to comply. The network is the property of the ISP and it is free to
do as it chooses with it as long as it does not interfere with the property of
others. There is no place in either situation for the government to come in
and regulate the ISPs. Humans do not have a 'right to the internet' simply
because we do not have a right to the property of others.

This is not to say that I am against an open internet in which I am free to
do as I please. I would most certainly prefer that ISPs behave according to
the principles of net neutrality. My point is that I do not believe the
government has any role in forcing others to comply with its will, even if it
is best for society. The government may of course create its own service,
although I would rather this not happen for two reasons. The first is simply
that I do not want the government touching my data (although it already does), 
and the second is that I would then be taxed for this service and this tax
would be me paying for the a service provided to others. I am not obligated to
pay for a service to any other human, especially if it is not a right, and no
one has a right to the internet.

If the airlines were to initiate pat downs and screenings to thwart terrorist
threats my view would be the same. (Note that they are not doing this, it is the
TSA that is doing this. Airlines probably would not do much of this because they
have feedback mechanize, the cost of the screeners and the annoyance to
customers built in. The TSA does not have this, which is why it is so
inefficient.) I am personally against it, but I am not allowed to use force
to make the airlines comply with my will. The airlines are allowed to act as
they please as long as what they does not interfere with the rights of others.

So I believe that I have made it clear that I am for net neutrality but
against the regulation or forcing of net neutrality onto ISPs. My views
primarily stem from that of the [Libertarians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism).
Several works have influenced my thinking, here are a few: [http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism),
