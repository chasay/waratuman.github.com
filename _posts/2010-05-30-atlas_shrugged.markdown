These are the principles of a man riding a train powered by a coal locomotive
into a tunnel without proper ventilation. These are the principles forced on
the people by the government. The country is unproductive, the people have no 
hope. The people have given into the ideals that those in
society who are the most productive and wealthy are under obligation to freely
give to those who are less fortunate.

At the point of a gun profitable businesses are cannibalized by policies put in
place by the governing institutions. The people need jobs! Times are hard and
we all must do our part! This is the cry of the government and
the people. Output is regulated to create a *free* market. Prices are
controlled to stimulate growth. Jobs are given out based on need and 
not qualification.

These are the practices that cause the great leaders of society to take a step
back and no longer bear the responsibility, because it was torn from them,
just as the profits were stolen from them. These men and women disappear,
leaving society without anyone who is responsible. The great spirit that once
drove the country is gone with these men and women, because *what difference
does it make to you whether you live or die, anyway?*.

The principles that sought to create equality among men and promote charity
has put the man in Bedroom A, Car No. 14 in his grave.
