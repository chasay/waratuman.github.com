title: What I Didn't Learn in Econ 101

I took Economics 101 in college. Economics was a subject that has always
interested me, so I was happy to take a few courses on the subject. Like many
of my other classes, I don't remember much. All I can recall from this course
is the introduction to [Adam Smith's invisible hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand),
a few graphs, and some details about [Keynesian economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics).

But what is the nature of economic theory? I had no idea until I read [The
Use of Knowledge in Society](http://econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html) by
[Friedrich Hayek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek) a few days ago.

A logical answer might be how to make best use of available means to bring
economic prosperity. To answer this we have to "possess all relevant
information," "start out from a given system of preferences," and "command
complete knowledge of available means." This reveals and even more fundamental
problem in economics, "the problem of utilization of knowledge which is not
given to anyone in its totality."

How is planning to be done so that the economy operate efficiently?
Should it be done by a central authority? Should it be divided among
individuals? Should it be done by delegating it to some kind of representative
for an industry or group of people?

Hayek points out that the answer to this question will depend on a what kind
of knowledge is given the greatest importance. Scientific knowledge is given
high value, especially today. With this knowledge it makes sense that a
chosen expert or set of experts may be the best to carryout the planning. But
what of the "knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular
circumstances of time and place." Given this, every individual possesses some
information which can be used to his benefit. Take for example a real estate
agent who makes his living off temporary opportunities, he may know of certain
high quality leases that will be ending that others do not know.

Often someone who employs theoretical or technical knowledge often values it
so high, that when someone who employees this general knowledge to gain an
advantage is thought to act dishonorably. Being an engineer myself, this
attitude is prevalent among scientists and engineers. Perhaps it is because
this general knowledge is so simple in comparison that it should yield no
distinct advantage and should be available to all. But if this knowledge was
available, then economics would not seek to answer this question. It is the
fact that this knowledge is not generally available all that its value comes
from. (Hayek goes onto point out that statistical aggregates are unable to
draw upon this knowledge, making the job of a central planner incredibly
difficult).

This brings us to the [price system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_system),
a beautiful means of transferring essential information and only to those who
are concerned. The consumer doesn't need to concern himself with the details
of the means of production, demand, or scarcity of an item. This information
is summed up in the price. Should a resource become more scare a consumer will
lessen his dependence on the product simply because of a change in price.
Individuals will be guided by the change in price. This allows for individuals
to act appropriately, with regard to the market, without anyone telling him
how to act. Through the price system comes the division of labor and
coordinated utilization of resources, all based on the knowledge of each
individual.

This is the heart of economics: "the problem of utilization of knowledge which
is not given to anyone in its totality." The graphs in Economics 101 made for
some pretty pictures, but which Hayek points out, "in effect starts from the
assumption that people's knowledge corresponds with objective facts of the
situation, systematically leaves out what is our main task to explain."
