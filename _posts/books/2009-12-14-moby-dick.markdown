### Description

The plot is simple: The *Pequod*, commanded by peg-legged Captain
Ahab, sets out on a whaling voyage. While the crew, a mixture of
nationalities, race, and religions, diligently hunts whales, Ahab
stays below deck, emerging only to announce that the real purpose of
the trip is to kill *Moby-Dick*, the white sperm whale that tore off
his right leg. Once sighted, the whale draws Ahab and the crew into a
final battle.

Melville drew on his experiences aboard the whaler *Acushnet* for the
encyclopedic details that saturate *Moby-Dick*. The name of the whale
probably came from an actual white sperm whale, "Mocha Dick," that had
been written about in 1839.

Misunderstood when published, *Moby-Dick* waited almost seventy years
to be recognized as an American masterpiece.
