### Description

New York state assemblyman, assistant secretary of the Navy, governor
of New York, vice president and, at forty-two, the youngest president
ever---in his own words, Theodore Roosevelt "rose like a rocket."
Roosevelt's accomplishments in office were immense. Believing that the
merging aristocracy of wealth represented a genuine threat to
democracy, TR broke trust to curb the rapacity of big business. He
built the Panama Canal and engaged the country in world affairs. And
he won the Nobel Peace Prize---the only sitting president ever so
honored. In lapidary prose, *Lion in the White House* recounts the
courageous life of one of the greatest leaders our nation has ever known.
