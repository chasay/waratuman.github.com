### Description

Set in sixteenth-century England, Mark Twain's classic "tale for young
people of all ages" features two identical-looking boys---a prince and
a pauper---who trade clothes and step into each other's lives. While
the urchin, Tom Canty, discovers luxury and power, Price Edward,
dressed in rags, roams his kingdom and experiences the cruelties
inflicted on the poor by the Tudor monarchy. As Christopher Paul
Curtis observes in his Introduction, *The Prince and the Pauper* is
"funny, adventurous, and exciting, yet also chock-full
of... exquisitely reasoned harangues against society's ills."

This Moder Library Paperback Classic is set from the Mark Twain
Project edition, which is the approved text of the Center for
Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association.
