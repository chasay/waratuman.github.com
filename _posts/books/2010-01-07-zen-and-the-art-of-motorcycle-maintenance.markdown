### Description

One of the most important and influential books of the past
half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance* is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how
we live and a meditation on how to live better. The narrative of a
father on a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest with his
young son, it becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey
into life's fundamental questions. A true modern classic, it remains
at once touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions
of existence and the small, essential triumphs that propel us
forward.
