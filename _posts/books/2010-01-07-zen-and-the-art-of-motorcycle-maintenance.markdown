### Description

"The solutions all are simple&hellip; after you've already
arrived at them. But they're simple only when you already know what
they are."

One of the most important and influential books of the past
half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance* is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how
we live and a meditation on how to live better. Pirsig's narrative of
a father and son on a summer motorcycle trip across America's
Northwest becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into
life's fundamental questions. A true modern classic, it remains at
once touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of
existence and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.
