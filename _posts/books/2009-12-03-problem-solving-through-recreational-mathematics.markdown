### Description

Historically, many of the most important mathematical concepts arose from
problems that were recreational in origin. This book takes advantage
of that fact, using recreational mathematics---problems, puzzles and
games---to teach students how to think critically. Encouraging active
participation rather than just observation, the book focuses less on
mathematical results than on how these results can be applied to
thinking about problems and solving them.

Each chapter contains a diverse array of problems in such areas as
logic, number and graph theory, two-player games of strategy,
solitaire games and puzzles, and much more. Sample problems (solved
in the text) whet the readers' appetites and motivate discussions;
practice problems solidify their grasp of mathematical ideas; and
exercises challenge them, fostering problem-solving
ability. Appendixes contain information on basic algebraic techniques
and mathematical inductions, and other helpful addenda include hints
and solutions, plus answers to selected problems. An extensive
appendix on probability is new to this Dover edition.
