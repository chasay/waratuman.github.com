### Description

Serving on a jury at the trial of a prostitute arrested for murder,
Prince Nekhlyudov is horrified to discover that the accused is a woman
he had once loved, seduce and then abandoned when she was a young
servant girl. Racked with guild at realizing he was the cause of her
ruin, he determines to appeal for her release or give up his own way
of live to follow her. Conceived on an epic scale, *Resurrection*
portrays a vast panorama of Russian life, taking us from the
underworld of prison cells and warders to the palaces of
countesses. It is also an angry denunciation of government, the upper
classes, the judicial system and the Church, and a highly personal
statement of Tolstoy's belief in human redemption.

Rosemary Edmonds's fine translation is accompanied by an introduction
discussing how *Resurrection* relates to Tolstoy's own spiritual
development and how the scope and depth of the book are even more
ambitious than in his other works.
