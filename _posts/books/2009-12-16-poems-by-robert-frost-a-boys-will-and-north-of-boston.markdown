### Description

The publication of *A Boy's Will* (1913) and *North of Boston* (1914)
marked the debut of Robert Frost as a major talent and established him
as the true poetic voice of New England. Four of his volumes would win
the Pulitzer Prize before his death in 1963, and his body of work has
since become an integral part of the American national heritage.

This is the only edition to present these two classics in their
original form. *A Boy's Will* introduced readers to Frost's
unmistakable poetic voice, and in *North of Boston*, we find two of
his most famous poems, "Mending Wall" and "The Death of the Hired
Man." With an introduction by distinguished critic and Amherst
professor William H. Pritchard, a new afterword by poet and critic
Peter Davison, and a newly updated bibliography, this edition stands
as a complete and vital introduction to the work of the quintessential
modern American poet.
