### Description

Sun Valley, Idaho---playground of the wealthy and politically
connected---is home to an annual wine auction that attracts high
rollers from across the country, and Blaine Country sheriff Walt
Fleming must ensure it goes on without a hitch. The world's most elite
wine connoisseurs have descended on Sun Valley to taste and bid on the
world's best wines, including three bottles said to have been a gift
from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams. With sky-high prices all the
guaranteed for these historic items, it's no wonder a group of thieves
is out to steal them. Walt is responsible for all the security for the
glitzy event, the safety of the dignitaries, the auction site, and the
wine themselves.

Walt is enjoying a rare afternoon of freedom, fly-fishing with his
nephew Kevin, when a passing truck catches his eye---and his
suspicions throw him headlong into the discovery of a complicated
plant to steal the rare wine. When a bomb explodes just as the auction
revs up, the investigation explodes as well, pulling Walt in a dozen
different directions. He is caught in the middle of a heist of epic
proportions---and not the heist he had prepared for---orchestrated by
the ingenious mind of Christopher Cantell, a man who seems to have
prepared for everything, including the way Walt's own sheriff's office
will react.
