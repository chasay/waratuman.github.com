### Description

"To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last
rains came gently and they did not cut the scarred earth."

*The Grapes of Wrath* is a landmark of American literature. A portrait
 of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man's
 fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman's stoical strength,
 the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes
 into the very nature of equality and justice in America. Although it
 follows the movement of thousands of men and women and the
 transformation of an entire nation, *The Grapes of Wrath* is also the
 story of one Oklahoma family, the Joads,who are driven off their
 homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of
 California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against
 the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and the Have-Nots
 evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and
 moral vision, elemental yet plain-spoken, tragic but ultimately
 stirring in its human dignity.

First published in 1939, *The Grapes of Wrath* summed up its era in
the way that *Uncle Tom's Cabin* summed up the years of slavery before
the Civil War. Sensitive to fascist and communist criticism, Steinbeck
insisted that "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" be printed in its
entirety in the first edition of the book---which takes its title from
the  first verse: "He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes
wrath are stored." At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative,
road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck's fictional chronicle
of the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s is perhaps the most American
of American Classics.
