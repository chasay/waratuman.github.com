Action is rational. When man acts he does so under the assumption
that the ends which he seeks will make him happier then he currently is, that
acting will remove any uneasiness felt as a result of the difference states,
and that by acting he is able to influence his current condition. If neither
of these were true, man would not act. In fact he would be in a state of
satisfaction in which acting would result in a worse state of affairs.

Mans current condition and possible future conditions are a subjective value.
What one man values may not be what another values. In [Human Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Action), [Mises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises) states that &#8220;each man is free to [choose] the relative values of his actions.&#8221; This can not be denied man, even in
a planned economy. Man will always value to his actions, wether that action is to
continue to serve the authorities or to revolt. There is no universal &#8220;yardstick&#8221; when it comes to
judging the value actions. One man may wish above all to achieve some &#8220;higher&#8221;
goal and yet another may wish above all to satisfy his material desires.
Because of the subjective value of actions nobody can judge what would make
someone else happy, as no man is in a position to replace his goals for that
of anyone else. The achievement of &#8220;higher&#8221; ends to the man who values them is
just as rational as the achievement of material ends by he who holds his material well being in
high regard. Neither science, which is merely the study and observation of the
world through observation and experimentation, nor any other human being, who
cannot hold the same value as any other man, is able to judge either the
religious man or the self-indulgent man.

Just because a man tries to achieve an ends and fails either because of some
unknown condition, a misunderstanding of the world, or an error in logic does not mean that the person acted
irrationally. All that is required is that he believe that his actions are
able to influence his current state into a happier state. Under these
assumptions, which must be believed in order to act, then action is by
definition rational. The rationality of an action does not depend on the
outcome. If a man believes that by chanting he can bring down rain and he
begins to chant, he is acting rationally even if the means will not bring
about the rain to fall.
